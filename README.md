# blinking_lights
Project blinking_lights allows user to control user LED's on a KC705 evaluation board using VIO controls. Given specific source parameters, eight LED's are grouped into pairs, and controlled by four switches. Each pair of LED's blinks at a different rate. The VIO allows the user to observe the activity of the LED's, as well as control their activity with toggle buttons. If user wants to manually control the LED's using the switches, the VIO outputs would need to be removed.
