# blinking_lights
Project blinking_lights allows user to control user LED's on a KC705 evaluation board using VIO controls. Given specific source parameters, eight LED's are grouped into pairs, and controlled by four switches. Each pair of LED's blinks at a different rate. The VIO allows the user to observe the activity of the LED's, as well as manually control their activity with toggle buttons.
